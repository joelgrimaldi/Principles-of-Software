1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentExceptiontest? 
    What did you have to do to fix it?
   
Because the first if statement included 0, there was an illegal
argument exception every time the program ran. By changing this
to x < 0 instead of x <= 0 this error disappeared.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCasetest? What (if anything) 
	did you have to do to fix it?
	
Initially failed because 0 was not initialized to value 1. I changed 
the values of the elif statement to 0 and 1 instead of 1 and 2 to
solve this problem.
	
3. Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test?What (if anything) 
	did you have to do to fix it?
	
Failed because of the incorrect equation at the bottom, initially subtracting
f(n+1) and f(n-2). The fix to this is changing this to the correct equation, 
f(n-1) + f(n-2).
