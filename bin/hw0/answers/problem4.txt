Problems with Ball.java:
	-When initializing variables didn't use this.color and
	this.volume
	-When using getVolume() getColor() returned null and 0
	instead of this.color and this.volume
	
I did not make any changes to the other classes in the implementation
of the getSmallest function.

2 different ways of implementing getBallsFromSmallest:
	- Using a TreeSet the way that I did setting a sort
	comparator and implementing in the creation of the TreeSet,
	then putting in the balls one by one and adding iterator.
	- Using a comparator and creating a clone of the ballContainer
	set in an array list and turning it into an iterator.
	
I think that the best way is using the TreeSet because it is much
easier to implement and is automatically sorted by just including
the sort method in the parentheses.
